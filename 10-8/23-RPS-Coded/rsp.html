### Rock Paper Scissors Pseudocode
1. Prompt user to enter r, p, or s representing rock, paper, or scissors.
2. Computer chooses a random value in a list of r, p, or s.
3. We determine if the user wins or not.
   * If user picks rock and if computer picks scissors then user wins.
   * If user picks rock and if computer picks paper then user loses.
   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks rock then user loses.
   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks paper then user wins.
   * If user picks paper and if computer picks rock then user wins.
   * If user picks paper and if computer picks scissors then user loses.
   * If user picks the same as computer then they tie.
4. We then add to their score.
   * If user wins then we add one to their wins.
   * If user loses then we add one to their losses.
   * If user ties then we add one to their ties.
5. Prompt user to play again.
